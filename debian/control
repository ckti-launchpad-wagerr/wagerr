Description: wagerr, digital currency for decentralized betting
 Wagerr is a decentralized sportsbook that changes the way the world
 bets on sports.
 . 
 - built for everyone.
 Wagerr uses distributed
 blockchain technology to execute betting contracts. It escrows
 stakes, verifies results, and pays out winners. By eliminating
 centralauthorities, Wagerr solves the most pernicious problems in
 the industry. Reducing corruption and risk results in predictable
 operation. You can bet on Wagerr.
 - Free of All regulatory bodies
 - Unrestricted global Access
 - Support for all major sport leagues
 - Truly Deflationary Chain
 - Value Coupling
 Nearly half of all fees are systematically destroyed — and
 destroying fees diminishes coin supply. It’s a simple matter of
 - supply and demand
 Given steady demand, free markets tend to respond to a dwindling
 supply with rising asset price. Holders of the asset will only
 sell it for the highest price the market will bear. Watch the
 video and check out the “economics” tab for more details on how
 the Wagerr economy works.
